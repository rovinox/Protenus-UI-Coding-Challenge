# Protenus UI Coding Challenge

## Introduction
The purpose of this challenge is for us to understand how you code and to see how you tackle a problem. We are not expecting a "right" or a "perfect" solution - so let loose and do what you do best.

## Problem
For this challenge, you are tasked with creating a Netflix-style movie queue. The hard requirements are simply 1) **present a list of movies in a catalog** and 2) **allow the user to manage their personal queue by adding, removing, and re-ordering the movies.** Beyond that you are free to add to the application as you see fit. This may come in the form of styling, graphics, a lightweight back-end, unit-tests, etc.

## Technologies
As our products are built in React, we would prefer the solution to this challenge would follow suit. However, if you are unfamiliar with React but an absolute ninja in Angular for example, we are able to work with that. Otherwise, you are encouraged to add any dependencies/technologies to make this task easier.

## Logistics
If at any time you have a question about this task, feel free to reach out to one of the development team members. When you have finished we would like you to **submit your code using the Greenhouse upload link or Dropbox, Google Drive, etc. (*not* a Git branch/fork).**

## Setup

This repository is essentially a bootstrapped [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) project with some slight modifications. Head over to their Github page for more documentation. To get started you will want to:

1. Install npm
1. Install create-react-app globally with ```npm install -g create-react-app```
1. Clone this repository with ```git clone https://github.com/ProtenusInc/ui-code-challenge.git```
1. Start the back-end server by executing ```nodemon```
1. Start up the application by executing ```npm start``` from within the ui-code-challenge directory
1. Your application should be accessible in your browser via ```http://localhost:3000```




That's it! From this point on you can go wild with repository.
